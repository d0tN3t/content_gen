Victorian moderate Kelly O'Dyer, long viewed as a rising Liberal Party star, has leapfrogged the outer ministry into cabinet as Small Business Minister, replacing Bruce billion. Ms O'Dyer also takes on the role of Assistant Treasurer, which has been elevated to a cabinet position. Mr Turnbull said this makes her \u201cthe first woman to be elevated to cabinet within the Treasury portfolio,\u201d although Labor's Penny Wong was finance minister, and Liberal Helen Conan was assistant treasurer in the Howard government when it was not a cabinet post in its own right. Senator Payne's shock elevation comes at the direct expense of the outgoing defense minister Kevin Andrews, and former treasurer Mr Hockey who had been tipped for the role after being moved from his own spot in Tony Abbott's cabinet. Mr Hockey is the highest profile casualty in a slew of sackings and resignations that have removed several former Howard government ministers from the front bench. The clean-out has allowed Mr Turnbull to move several fresh faces into the ministry and reward some of his key backers in Monday night's leadership spill.

The Knights extracted long-awaited revenge for last year's devastating grand final loss with a resounding 44-12 victory to eliminate reigning premiers the Penrith Panthers. In a rematch of the 2014 VB MSW Cup Grand Final, the Knights held a 10-6 halftime lead before they took the Panthers to school in the second half and bury last year's demons. Bolstered by his time in first grade, Jake Mao destroyed the Panthers with a scintillating hat-trick of tries as well as setting up one of the tries of the year, placing a pinpoint-accurate chip kick in full flight for Jerrod Holland to regather and score. The Knights season redemption continues with an epic showdown against the minor premiers, Mounties, for their chance to return to the grand final. After eliminating premiership dark horses - the North Sydney Bears - last week, the Bulldogs bounced competition heavyweights Warriors from the VB MSW Cup Finals Series with an impressive **33-20 victory. Janine Graham was simply electric with an instrumental performance to put the Bulldogs just 80 minutes away from the grand final. Graham earned man-of-the-match honors with two of the best solo tries you will ever see in any level of football (it was Benji Marshall-esque) that left fans with tongues wagging from their mouths. Desperate to bounce back from last week's loss in the qualifying finals, the Warriors took the fight right to the Bulldogs pack in a first-half arm wrestle.

A 53-yard pass from Henry Burris to Ernest Jackson late in the fourth quarter set up a 14-yard field goal by Chris Milo, allowing the Redblacks to escape with a 30-27 victory against the Roughriders before an announced crowd of 30,480 at Mosaic Stadium. Naaman Roosevelt beat the Redblacks' Abdul Kanneh along the right sideline, caught the lofted pass from Kevin Glenn and completed a 71-yard touchdown play. A 42-yard kickoff return by Tristan Jackson inspired Saskatchewan's offense to drive 53 yards in six plays, the last of them a 20-yard toss from Glenn to Ryan Smith. Following a 56-yard punt single by Brett Mahler, McCall um kicked another field goal from 39 yards and Milo made one from 46, all of which left the Roughriders with a 20-14 lead at halftime. That drive was unnecessarily extended by two major penalties against the Redblacks -- a horse-collar tackle by Shawn Lemon and unnecessary roughness against Mali Jackson -- on the very same play. A 70-yard drive by the Redblacks produced a go-ahead, one-yard touchdown run by Burris with 2:34 remaining, but Milo hit the upright with the convert attempt from 32 yards, leaving the lead at three points: 27-24. However, Burris, who threw for 477 yards on the night, led a seven-play drive, featuring most prominently the long strike to Jackson, who was somehow left wide open by Roughriders defenders. Saskatchewan also wasted its timeout just before Milo made the final kick, so they were left only with a Hail Mary attempt that Kanneh intercepted. Ernest Jackson: That 53-yard reception to set up the winning field goal was the kind of strike expected of the Redblacks' fleet of new receivers when they were signed in the off season. James Green: The Redblacks special-teamer racked up consecutive major penalties in the first half, earning himself an earful from assistant coach Don Yanowsky.

The second row of the grid in Sunday's race has the same mix with Ferrari's Kim Raikkonen qualifying third and Red Bull's Danial Kvyat in a career-best fourth. Drivers' championship leader Hamilton qualified an unfamiliar fifth and Mercedes teammate Nice Rosberg sixth on the Marina Bay street circuit, which largely neutralized the team's long-held power advantage. Hamilton had been going for his eighth straight pole, which would have equaled the record set by his idol Ayrton Senna across the 1988 and 1989 seasons, while Mercedes had been aiming for its 24th in a row, which would have tied the all-time mark set by the Williams team over 1992 and 1993. It was vetted's first pole position since Brazil in 2013 when he drove for Red Bull, and Ferrari's first since the 2012 German Grand pix -- a gap of 61 races. Hamilton was perplexed by Mercedes failure to generate enough grip from the tires, which he identified as the cause of the team's unfamiliar pace deficit. \u201cThe goal is still to win the race, but it's very hard to overtake here, and the others, particularly the Red Bulls, were incredibly quick through the long runs. vetted also has 41, and he now looks a strong chance to move into outright third on the all-time list, behind only Michael Schumacher and Alan Frost. Ricciardo's second place matched his career best but a first pole position still eludes the Australian, who has three race wins. The team had been bullish that its nimble handling would come to the fore through the frequent right-angle corners on the Singapore street circuit, where sheer engine power is not as important.

But a spokesman for Fannie Mae told the Free Press last week that time is running out for Whitfield, and she must move soon, even if supporters pitch in to help her buy the house. The property, appraised two years ago at $9,000, is saddled with nearly $60,000 in debt accrued on a reverse mortgage that was taken out in 2005 by Whitfield's late mother, court records show. Although federal lending rules initially gave Whitfield a chance to buy the house for 90% of its appraised value, she missed the deadline, saying she was frightened and confused by foreclosure threats in letters from lawyers representing Fannie Mae and a previous creditor. They warn that reverse mortgages may seem attractive to elderly homeowners today but they can be onerous years from now for future heirs like Whitfield who inherit a house. Fannie Mae insists that Whitfield move out as part of the federal regulatory requirements of HUD -- the U.S. Housing and Urban Development. After the Free Press got involved, Fannie Mae offered to sell Whitfield the house -- at a price \u201cthat we believe she would be able to afford,\u201d Wilson said, presumably near the appraised value -- but only if she moves out. She'd need to vacate for 30 to 60 days, her lawyer said, because \u201cthat's usually how long it takes\u201d for Fannie Mae and HUD to complete a required inspection and reappraisal of the house, followed by a court hearing, attorney Matthew Clark said. A way out of the impasse might be for HUD to relax its rules, and to grant \u201csomething called 'occupied conveyance' -- that's an explicit exception for high-crime areas, to keep people in their homes,\u201d Clark said. Soon after, HUD's Detroit Field Office Director Michael Polsinelli said he drove past Whitfield's house and hoped a resolution could be found.

Many of the thousands of fans who flocked to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday to watch Ireland take on Canada cheerfully ignored the ban on large hats. Irish fans decked themselves in giant shamrocks and green leprechaun hats, while the Canadians brandished large blow up lumberjack axes. While some fans sympathies with the Rugby World Cup's attempts to ensure their views of the pitch are not obscured by flags and large hats, they fear the atmosphere could suffer. Dean Bartlett, 24, an IT consultant from Bedfordshire, who was at Twickenham on Friday for England's opening game dressed in a full crusader outfit, said: \u201cI can understand why they've done it, but it's part of the atmosphere and I think people will bring that kind of thing anyway. The row began when it emerged that the organizers had drawn up a list of restricted items which \u201cmight compromise or otherwise interfere with the enjoyment or comfort of any person at the venue\u201d. The organizers, forced onto the back foot, have issued a statement recognizing \u201cthe significant role that bagpipes play in Scottish and world rugby heritage\u201d. In an attempt to broker a compromise Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, has promised to raise the matter with tournament organizers ahead of Wednesday's match. That is unlikely to satisfy Scottish fans - or the South Africans and Irish for that matter - who look set to continue trying to take banned items into stadiums, whether they are bagpipes, vuvuzelas or large flags. More than 80,000 fans raised the roof at Twickenham stadium when England beat Fiji after a glittering opening ceremony on Friday night, which drew a television audience of 7.56 million. Attention will now turn to Scotland's opening game against Japan on Wednesday, when thousands of Scots will flock to Gloucester's Kingsholm stadium for what will be the first test of the bagpipe ban.

It is not their first appearance on the show - but stars Luke lemmings and Aston Irwin seemed less than comfortable in trying to throw together a fish stew. First chef Simon showed them how to slice monkish and squid for the Spanish-inspired dish. As Luke attempted to follow his admittedly simple instructions, he waved his somewhat large knife around and said: \u201cI'm so nervous. What if I get it wrong?\u201d The 5SoS boys had a blast on the morning show as fans flocked to social media to reveal they had only tuned in to watch them.

The guests put a brave face on when they tried the dish, although not everyone reckons fish stew is a great idea for a Sunday morning treat... Michael Clifford was more interested in trying the other food on offer than cooking himself. \u201cThat is what this TV show should be every week,\u201d he said, tucking into some chicken and mayo. \u201cJust more and more fried chicken.\u201d", "categories": [""], "title": "Relish Sunday Brunch With Willie Kelvin"}{"mt_keywords": ["Johnny Marr", "bulls **t", "Marr"], "dateCreated": "20151018T17:22:00", "description": " This is the question every music journalist on the planet (and further afield) has been itching to ask the former Smiths' guitarist since the iconic band's exceedingly acrimonious 1987 break-ups.

Tickets for the first three months of the show's run, from 7 June until 18 September 2016, have now sold out. Those for shows running between September and 8 January 2017 were due to be released for public sale on Saturday, but are now available to more Priority Booking customers. Annabelle Fawkes, a 20-year-old student from Brighton, was one of many who suffered from technical problems, and ended up being charged more than PS400 extra in the process.
